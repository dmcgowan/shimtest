// Package shimtest is a conformance test suite for containerd shim
// implementations. The tests are organized into Suites — RunSuite,
// ExecSuite, TransferSuite, UDSSuite, OOMSuite — each gated against
// one feature key. Callers construct a Config and call the suite's
// Run method (or Bench / Fuzz) from their own test functions:
//
//	func TestMyShim(t *testing.T) {
//	    cfg := shimtest.Config{ShimBinary: "containerd-shim-myshim-v1"}
//	    shimtest.NewRunSuite(cfg).Run(t)
//	    shimtest.NewExecSuite(cfg).Run(t)
//	}
package shimtest

// shimtestNamespace is the containerd namespace used for all shimtest
// operations.
const shimtestNamespace = "shimtest"

// Config carries everything a suite needs to bring up a shim.
// Callers identify their shim and tune setup behavior via this
// struct; suites hold a copy and use it for every test they run.
//
// Config has no Skip field — choosing which suites to run is the
// caller's concern (skip a feature by not constructing the
// corresponding suite).
type Config struct {
	// ShimBinary is the name (resolved via PATH) or absolute path of
	// the shim binary under test.
	ShimBinary string

	// FormatMounts, when true, provides the rootfs to the shim as
	// formatted erofs/ext4 images plus a format/mkdir/overlay mount
	// descriptor — appropriate for VM-based shims that mount the
	// rootfs themselves. When false the rootfs is extracted (or
	// overlay-mounted on the host) and provided pre-mounted.
	FormatMounts bool

	// Env is a set of environment variables propagated to processes
	// spawned by the harness (the shim binary, runc, etc.). The local
	// JSON-driven runner applies this via os.Setenv before any test
	// runs; library callers can pre-populate the process environment
	// directly and leave this empty.
	Env map[string]string

	// Debug enables verbose logging from the shim.
	Debug bool

	// ContainerAnnotations is a static set of OCI annotations applied
	// to every container's spec (config.json) — both standalone
	// containers and sandbox member containers.
	ContainerAnnotations map[string]string

	// ProvideNetwork tells NetworkSuite to set up a container's
	// network connectivity itself (a dedicated network namespace plus
	// a slirp4netns process attached to it; see attachContainerNetwork
	// in helpers_netns_linux.go) rather than assuming the shim already
	// provides a working default network path.
	//
	// Leave this false for any shim that already gives containers real
	// networking on its own (e.g. a VM-based shim bridging guest
	// traffic to the host) — NetworkSuite then tests that default path
	// directly, exactly as it always has. Set it true only for shims
	// with no network setup of their own, which otherwise leave a
	// container in an empty, unconfigured network namespace: the
	// suite's tests would otherwise be unsatisfiable through no fault
	// of the shim, since providing container networking isn't part of
	// the shim v2 API contract at all.
	ProvideNetwork bool
